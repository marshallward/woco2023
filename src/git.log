    +Remove build_grid_arbitrary
    
      Removed the unused (and unusable) routine build_grid_arbitrary.
      This routine could not have been used because it had a hard-coded
      STOP call, and comments in it indicated that it should have been
      deleted in July, 2013.  The run-time parameter setting that would
      have triggered a call to this routine has been retained for now,
      but with a fatal error message explaining that this routine has
      not been implemented.   All answers are bitwise identical in any
      cases that ran before.

    extension to the internal tides module (#481)
    
    the module in now able to read in tidal velocities for different
    tidal harmonics and distribute the energy and distribute TKE input over
    the different vertical modes. This involves upsizing dimensions of
    several arrays and mofiying some API. internal_tide_input_CS is
    promoted to public to facilitate the passing of energy input to
    MOM_internal_tides

    +Add timestamp and directory to particles restart
    
    The directory, time and timestamp variables are needed by the
    particle code in order to write better restart files. I have changed
    the particles_save_restart interface to add these variables. I have
    also removed the option to pass temperature and salinity to
    particles_save_restart, because these variables are not useful for
    restart.

    ice shelf front advection: When determining a reference thickness
    for a partially-filled cell, add the reference thickness
    contribution from a neighboring filled cell proportionate to its
    flux into the partially-filled cell. This is more accurate than
    simply taking the average thickness of all neighboring filled cells.
    Also fixed incorrect bounds. (#475)

    Ice sheet thickness boundary condition (#474)
    
    * allow for assigned ice shelf thickness where hmask==3, but still
      solve for ice sheet velocity
