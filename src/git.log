    +Fix dimensional rescaling with HARMONICS_SAL
    
      Corrected dimensional rescaling bugs in the spherical harmonics SAL code.  An
    issue with horizontal length scaling was corrected by using G%Rad_Earth_L in
    place of G%Rad_Earth in spherical_harmonics_init.  There are new optional
    tmp_scale arguments to calc_SAL and spherical_harmonics_forward to allow the
    rescaling to be undone before calling the reproducing sums.
    
      This commit also modifies the call to the reproducing sums in
    spherical_harmonics_forward so that all real or imaginary components are
    calculated with a single call, which reduces the cost of the SAL calculation
    reproducing sums from about 6.7 times the cost with non-reproducing sums to just
    5.5 times as much in testing with the tides_025 test case.
    
      There is also code added to avoid NaNs arising from a square root operating
    on a negative argument from a 32-bit integer roll-over when a very large
    number of harmonics components (more than 1024 x 1024) are unadvisedly being
    used.
    
      While this commit corrects the dimensional scaling when HARMONICS_SAL is true,
    all answers are bitwise identical when no rescaling is used or when the
    spherical harmonics SAL is not used.  There are new optional arguments to two
    publicly visible interfaces.

    +Remove rescale_grid_bathymetry
    
      Removed the unused routine rescale_grid_bathymetry.  This routine was added in
    August 2018 as a part of the development of the depth unit conversion and
    dimensional consistency testing, but it is no longer being called now that this
    conversion is essentially complete (and it has not been called by the code in
    several years).  For the original commit that first added this code, see
    github.com/mom-ocean/MOM6/commit/ddc9ed1c33a1b7357b213929118ecaa19ae63f9f.  All
    answers are bitwise identical.

    +Remove build_grid_arbitrary
    
      Removed the unused (and unusable) routine build_grid_arbitrary.  This routine
    could not have been used because it had a hard-coded STOP call, and comments in
    it indicated that it should have been deleted in July, 2013.  The run-time
    parameter setting that would have triggered a call to this routine has been
    retained for now, but with a fatal error message explaining that this routine
    has not been implemented.   All answers are bitwise identical in any cases that
    ran before.

    extension to the internal tides module (#481)
    
    the module in now able to read in tidal velocities for different
    tidal harmonics and distribute the energy and distribute TKE input over
    the different vertical modes. This involves upsizing dimensions of
    several arrays and mofiying some API. internal_tide_input_CS is
    promoted to public to facilitate the passing of energy input to
    MOM_internal_tides

    +Add timestamp and directory to particles restart
    
    The directory, time and timestamp variables are needed by the particle code in order to write better restart files. I have changed the particles_save_restart interface to add these variables. I have also removed the option to pass temperature and salinity to particles_save_restart, because these variables are not useful for restart.

    ice shelf front advection: When determining a reference thickness for a partially-filled cell, add the reference thickness contribution from a neighboring filled cell proportionate to its flux into the partially-filled cell. This is more accurate than simply taking the average thickness of all neighboring filled cells. Also fixed incorrect bounds. (#475)
